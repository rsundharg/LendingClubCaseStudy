## Recommendations

- High interest payments leads to high losses,  it is always better to consider low interest rates – So low risk at lower interest
- One of the driving factor for lender is , it can be seen that people who have worked for 10 or more years are more likely to take a loan. 
- Repayment structure is good  Average income of 100000 with more than 10 years of employment . So using this analysis the fund limit  can be  deciding factor for      finance company
- Data shows that the most (>90%) borrowers from Rented &Mortgage home than the Own home. Means more borrowers these categories approaching for loan.
